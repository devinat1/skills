# Safeguard gate (installation reference)

The active global gate is maintained in `~/.agentic/AGENTS.md`. This repository's
historical gate is superseded by that shared source; install the harness adapters
under `config/agentic/harnesses/` when configuring a harness.

<!-- Historical gate follows for project-level installation reference. -->

Before any **non-trivial feature, build, or refactor**, invoke the
`safeguard` skill via the **Skill tool** as your **first action**. Do not
Read the skill file — use the Skill tool.

**Do not** write code, scaffold, or edit implementation files until safeguard's
Plannotator plan and pattern list are approved, or the user opts out.

**Skip safeguard** when the user says **skip safeguard**, already provided a
detailed plan/issue, or is addressing bounded PR review comments.

**Route to `clarify`** for clear bug fixes with obvious scope.

**When in doubt:** prefer `clarify` for bugs; prefer `safeguard` when the
change adds behavior, crosses services/repos, or reshapes architecture.

Project repos may also define `.claude/rules/safeguard-gate.md`,
`.cursor/rules/safeguard-gate.mdc`, or `AGENTS.md` § Before building — follow
those in addition to this user rule.

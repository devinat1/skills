description: Convert the current conversation into a focused blog post (clarify scope first, then distill). Use when the user invokes /blog.

Turn this conversation into a blog post. Follow these steps exactly:

## Consequential advice

Before recommending editorial direction or related links as a consequential
choice, follow the `Advice gate` in `dissenter`.
When the gate applies, first say that you are using `/dissenter` and why.

## Blog location

Read `external_resources.blog` and `external_resources.blog_content` from
`~/.agentic/index.json` for the repository and content directory. Use those paths
throughout this workflow; do not require per-repo blog-directory setup.

## Step 1: Clarify post scope

Say that you are using `/clarify`'s interview discipline to narrow the post's
topic, audience, and boundaries.

Read and follow [`skills/productivity/clarify/SKILL.md`](../../productivity/clarify/SKILL.md) to interview the user before drafting.

### Clarify adaptation

Follow clarify's **interview discipline** only:

1. Explore project context — check files, docs, recent commits
2. Scope check — if the conversation spans multiple independent threads, flag it and clarify one slice at a time
3. Ask clarifying questions — extensively, one at a time — purpose, constraints, success criteria, non-goals, audience, what "done" looks like
4. Stop when thorough — all three pillars are specific enough to act on

**Do not** follow clarify's HARD-GATE or end artifact. Do not output a copy-paste prompt. Do not stop after clarify. Do not draft during this phase.

Focus questions on: the single narrative thread, audience, angle, and what to include vs exclude from the conversation.

## Step 2: Summarize and gate

When clarify is thorough, present a brief summary:

- **Topic** — the one thing this post is about
- **Include** — what belongs in the post
- **Exclude** — what to leave out (even if it appeared in the conversation)
- **Shape** — intended structure or angle

Wait for explicit yes/no before proceeding. If the user says no, revise the summary or return to Step 1.

## Step 3: Study existing writing style

Read 3-5 existing posts from the blog content directory above to learn the user's writing style. Pay attention to:
- Tone (casual vs formal, use of humor, directness)
- Sentence structure and length
- How posts are structured (intro style, use of headings, how they conclude)
- Vocabulary and voice
- Use of code blocks, links, lists, and other formatting

## Step 4: Draft the post

Write a blog post draft in markdown **matching the writing style you observed in Step 3** and **the scope agreed in Steps 1–2**. The post should:
- Sound like the user wrote it, not an AI
- Follow one narrative thread — do not dump the full conversation
- Use proper markdown formatting (headings, code blocks, lists as appropriate)
- Include this frontmatter at the top:

```
---
draft: "false"
---
```

### Distill rules

Structure comes from existing posts (style-adaptive), but length and completeness do not mirror the conversation. A good post tells one story — e.g. the problem, the key design choice, one concrete example — not a transcript.

**Include:**
- One narrative thread agreed in clarify
- Core insight or story and key design decisions
- At most one concrete illustration where it earns its keep

**Exclude (even if in the conversation):**
- Implementation minutiae (file paths, configs, exact commands, full code listings)
- Side threads and tangents
- Step-by-step replay of how the chat unfolded

### Ponytail review gate

Say that you are using `ponytail-review` to remove over-engineered writing.
After drafting, invoke `$ponytail:ponytail-review` on the post. Apply valid `delete` and `shrink` findings, then review again until it reports `Lean already. Ship.` Do not show the draft, ask the user to act, save, or publish before this gate passes.

## Step 5: Show the draft for review

Present the full draft to the user. Ask:
- Does the content look good? Any sections to add, remove, or rewrite?
- What should the post title be? (This becomes the filename)

Incorporate all feedback. Repeat this step until the user approves.

## Step 6: Save the file

Save the final post to `<blog_content>/<title>.md`, using the indexed content directory and approved post title.

## Step 7: Update related links

Say that you are using `/update-blog-refs` to review cross-links for the saved
post.
Delegate related-link handling to [`update-blog-refs`](../update-blog-refs/SKILL.md). Follow it with:

- The indexed `blog_content` path as the supplied blog directory.
- The newly saved post as the focus post, so proposals include only links to or from it.
- Its approval gate before writing any related-link changes.

## Step 8: Publish (with confirmation)

Ask the user: "Ready to publish with `node ./quartz/bootstrap-cli.mjs sync`?"

Only if they confirm, run `node ./quartz/bootstrap-cli.mjs sync` from the indexed `blog` repository.

If they decline, let them know the file is saved and they can publish later.

After a successful publish or an intentional decision not to publish, append
the `blog` completion suggestions from
[skill connections](../../../docs/skill-connections.md).

## Incentive-check integration

At the stage described below, read `${AGENTIC_HOME:-$HOME/.agentic}/skills/incentive-check/INTEGRATIONS.md` and use **Run** mode. After the pre-drafting scope approval and before Step 4, check one material named outsider's public recommendation or forecast actually relied on in the draft. Preserve the studied writing style, approved scope, and publishing approvals. Use source attribution or a qualified observation in the draft; do not assess the user's ordinary self-promotion.

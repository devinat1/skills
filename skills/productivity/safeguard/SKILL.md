  REQUIRED before any non-trivial feature, build, or refactor: invoke this
  skill as your first action before code, scaffolding, plans, or exploratory
  edits. User and project gate rules mandate this. Interviews the user on
  company necessity, what/why, codebase impact, and scope. Also when user says
  "safeguard", "/safeguard", "understand before code", or "before building".
  Not for clear bug fixes (use clarify) or when a detailed plan/issue already
  exists.

# Safeguard

## Consequential advice

When the interview needs a recommended answer, follow the `Advice gate` in
`dissenter` first. Do not choose on the user's behalf.
When the gate applies, first say that you are using `/dissenter` and why.

Interview before implementation so the user understands how the work fits
the company and the codebase. One question at a time. Exit when all four
pillars are concrete enough to build safely — or when the user opts out.

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If the task adds behavior, crosses services/repos, or reshapes architecture,
you **must invoke this skill before any other tool use** (except readonly
context gathering in checklist step 1).

**Platform:** In Claude Code, invoke via the **Skill tool** (`safeguard`) — do
not Read this file. In Cursor, Read the project's
`.agents/skills/safeguard/SKILL.md`.

Do not rationalize skipping because the request "seems simple."

Subagents dispatched for implementation must also follow safeguard unless
the parent session already completed a Build Brief in the same thread.

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your
way out of this when the task is non-trivial.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

<HARD-GATE>
During the interview, do NOT write code, edit files, commit, scaffold, or
produce implementation plans. The gate lifts when the interview completes
(Build Brief delivered) or the user says **skip safeguard** (or similar).
</HARD-GATE>

## When this skill runs

**Invoke safeguard** for non-trivial features, builds, or refactors.

**Route to `clarify` instead** for clear bug fixes with obvious scope. Before
routing, say that you are using `/clarify` because the request is a bounded bug
rather than a feature build.

**Skip safeguard** (proceed directly) when any of these apply:

- User says **skip safeguard** or explicitly opts out at any time
- User already pasted a detailed plan or linked a GitHub issue/PRD that
  answers company necessity, what/why, impact, and scope
- User is addressing bounded review comments on an existing PR

**When in doubt** on bug vs feature: prefer `clarify` for bugs; prefer
`safeguard` when the change adds behavior, crosses services/repos, or reshapes
architecture.

## Checklist

Complete in order:

1. **Explore project context** — read project docs (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
   `CONTEXT.md` when present), affected paths, recent commits; note cross-repo
   or cross-service touch points
2. **Scope check** — if the request spans multiple independent subsystems,
   flag it and interview one slice at a time
3. **Interview — one question at a time** across the four pillars (below)
4. **Stop when thorough** — each pillar survives "what about when…?"
5. **Deliver Build Brief** — before drafting it for applicable coding work,
   load `${AGENTIC_HOME:-$HOME/.agentic}/skills/pattern-gate/SKILL.md` and
   include its pattern list in the brief (see template)
6. **Approve, compact, then build** — obtain approval of the brief and its
   pattern list together; ask the user to compact their context window,
   then continue implementation in the same session

## Four pillars

Cover each pillar before ending the interview. Do not skip a pillar because
the user sounds confident — vague one-liners need follow-ups.

| Pillar | What to establish |
|---|---|
| **Company necessity** | Is this actually needed for the company now? What problem does it solve? What happens if we don't build it? |
| **What & why** | What exactly are we building? Why this approach over alternatives? |
| **Codebase / system impact** | Which services, schemas, or flows are affected? What breaks if we get this wrong? Explore the repo — don't ask the user what you can read. |
| **Scope boundaries & non-goals** | What files/areas are in scope? What is explicitly out of scope? What must not change? |

## Question discipline

- **One question per message** — break complex topics into multiple turns
- **Explore the codebase** when impact or boundaries can be answered from
  the repo (read project docs, `CONTEXT.md`, call paths, schemas)
- **Provide a recommended answer** when the user is stuck — then continue
  interviewing (grill-me style, unlike `clarify`)
- **Multiple choice preferred** when it speeds answers
- **Purposeful, not bureaucratic** — don't interrogate trivial details;
  exit as soon as all four pillars are concrete enough to implement safely

## Opt-out

At any point the user may say **skip safeguard** (or similar). Acknowledge
briefly and proceed to implementation without the Build Brief. Do not
guilt-trip or re-run the interview unless they ask.

## Build Brief

When the interview completes (not skipped), output this brief in chat before
any implementation. For applicable coding work, fill the Pattern list using
`pattern-gate`'s name, where, and why format. Resolve open pattern choices
before approval; this list does not require an implementation plan during the
interview. Omit the section only when `pattern-gate` does not apply:

```md
## Build Brief

**Why:** [company necessity — the problem and why now]

**What:** [exactly what we're building]

**Affected areas:** [paths, schemas, flows, repos]

**Risks:** [what could go wrong; hard rules or invariants at stake]

**Pattern list:**
- [name — where it will show up — why it is being used]

**Done when:**
- [criterion]
- [criterion]

**Out of scope:**
- [non-goal]
```

Then tell the user:

> Compact your context window now (Cursor: /compact or the compact action).
> Once compacted, approve this brief and its pattern list, then reply **ready**
> and we'll implement from this brief.

Do not write code until the user approves the brief and its pattern list and
confirms ready (or explicitly asks to implement without compacting). A **ready**
reply alone is not pattern approval. Preserve both approvals through compaction.

## Relationship to other skills

| Skill | When |
|---|---|
| `clarify` | Vague ideas, discovery, clear bug fixes — ends with copy-paste prompt, no code |
| `safeguard` | Non-trivial builds — ends with Build Brief, then same-session implementation |
| `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` | After implementation, before opening a PR |

## Key principles

- **Understanding before damage** — the goal is holistic fit, not paperwork
- **Skippable** — power users and urgent fixes can opt out anytime
- **YAGNI in questioning** — ask what matters for safe implementation, not every hypothetical

## Codebase impact hints

When exploring impact, check gate and project docs first:

- **User gate** — `~/.agentic/AGENTS.md` (shared through each harness's instruction discovery entrypoint)
- **Project gates** — `.claude/rules/safeguard-gate.md`, `.cursor/rules/safeguard-gate.mdc`
- **Project guidance** — `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, hard rules, promotion flow, architecture notes
- **Monorepos / multi-repo** — which nested repos are touched; separate PRs per repo?
- **Cross-service work** — coordinated changes across multiple repositories?

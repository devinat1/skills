description: Navigate and write to the State and Church Obsidian vaults via CLI, including agent-managed notes under Agentic/. Use when the user wants to capture ideas, find notes, read vault context, or mentions Obsidian, either vault, zettels, or MOCs. Also covers Obsidian CLI syntax and plugin/theme development (reload, eval, screenshots, DOM).

# Obsidian

Teach agents **when** and **how** to work with the State and Church vaults through the Obsidian CLI — not the filesystem.

## Bootstrap

On every session involving vault work:

1. Read [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md).
2. Use MCP `user-obsidian` → `obsidian_cli` for all vault reads/writes.
3. If CLI calls fail, tell the user Obsidian or the requested vault may be unavailable — do not silently fall back to raw filesystem access. Vault locations are indexed in `~/.agentic/index.json` under `external_resources.obsidian_state` and `external_resources.obsidian_church`.

CLI syntax and navigation patterns: [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).

MCP `obsidian_cli` takes the command string **without** the `obsidian` prefix. Shell form is `obsidian <command>`. Parameters use `=`; flags (`silent`, `overwrite`) take no value. Always pass `vault=State` or `vault=Church` — do not rely on last-focused vault. Plugin/theme reload and debug: [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).

## Vault and folder routing

- Always pass `vault=State` or `vault=Church`; preserve any vault boundary in the user's request or calling workflow.
- Some agent-managed notes live under `Agentic/` in both vaults. For every named-note lookup, search the relevant vault's `Agentic/` folder before treating the note as missing. If no vault is specified, search `Agentic/` in both vaults.
- Read or update an existing match in place. Never recreate a moved note at its former path or create a duplicate. If the same named note exists in both vaults and the requested write is not explicitly for both, ask which vault to update.
- Create new agent-authored zettels under `Agentic/` in the selected vault unless the workflow explicitly requires another folder.

<HARD-GATE>
**Out of scope — use other skills instead:**

- Blog publishing / Quartz sync
- Periodic/daily/weekly/monthly notes (`#periodic`, `Periodic/`)
- Literature / Zotero notes (`#literature`, `Literature/`)
- Excalidraw drawing creation, edits, exports, CLI testing, and embeds (`![[...excalidraw]]`) — use [obsidian-excalidraw-cli](../obsidian-excalidraw-cli/SKILL.md) for native drawing operations
- Running Templater scripts (`<%* ... %>`) or QuickAdd macros
- Editing MOC bodies to list zettels — Dataview handles that in Obsidian UI

**Never** use raw filesystem tools on vault paths when Obsidian CLI is available.
</HARD-GATE>

## When to use Obsidian

| Use Obsidian | Use something else |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Capture an idea, insight, or link as a zettel | Todoist task → `focus` / `ramble` |
| Read existing notes for context on a topic | Meeting analysis → Granola / `meeting-feedback` |
| Find what's already written before building | Prior-art search → `literature-review` |
| Persist knowledge that should live in the graph | Session diagnostics → `experience` |

Trigger when the user mentions Obsidian, the State or Church vault, zettels, MOCs, or asks to save/find notes.

## Note-type judgment

No folder-level rules — decide by note type:

| Type | Tag | Agent behavior |
|------|-----|----------------|
| Atomic zettel | `idea` | Create/edit in `Agentic/` with full frontmatter |
| Map of Content | `MOC` | Read and navigate; link **to** it from new zettels; don't edit MOC for listing |
| Literature | `literature` | Out of scope |
| Periodic | `periodic` | Out of scope |
| Draft / clipping / file | varies | Read for context if useful; don't apply zettel rules unless asked |

## Workflows

### 1. Read for context

Before answering or building on a topic:

1. `search query="<topic>" vault=<State-or-Church> path=Agentic limit=20`; then search `path=Notes` when needed
2. Read promising hits with `read file=<name>`
3. If a MOC exists, `read file=<MOC>` then `backlinks file=<MOC> counts` to find linked zettels
4. Summarize what the vault already says; cite note titles

Ignore Dataview code blocks when reading — they won't execute via CLI.

### 2. Navigate a MOC graph

Dataview on MOC pages is UI-only. Approximate with:

1. Find MOC: search by topic keyword or `#MOC`
2. `backlinks file="<MOC Name>" counts` — zettels linking to this MOC
3. `links file=<zettel>` — outgoing connections
4. `property:read name=related file=<zettel>` — explicit graph edges

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for full command cheat sheet.

### 3. Create a zettel

Strict template match ([CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md), [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)):

1. Confirm topic and target MOC (search if unclear; ask one question if ambiguous)
2. `create name="<Title>" vault=<State-or-Church> path=Agentic/ content=<full note with frontmatter>`
3. Set `tags: [idea]`, today's date, `related:` with wikilink to MOC
4. Body content, then `---` and `## References` section
5. **Do not edit the MOC** — linking from the zettel's `related:` is enough; Dataview lists it in Obsidian

Title = filename. One atomic idea per note.

### 4. Edit a zettel

1. `read file=<name>` first — never blind-write
2. Prefer surgical edits: `append`, `prepend`, or `property:set`
3. Preserve existing frontmatter schema and References section
4. When adding a new MOC link, update `related:` on the zettel only

### 5. Capture from conversation

When the user shares an insight worth keeping:

1. Propose a zettel title and MOC placement
2. Show draft frontmatter + body for approval if the edit is substantial
3. Create via CLI after approval (or immediately if user said "save this to Obsidian")

## Rules

- One question at a time when MOC placement or title is ambiguous.
- Search before create — avoid duplicate zettels on the same idea.
- Wikilinks in `related:` use `[[Note Name]]` syntax matching existing vault names.
- Status emoji (🟥🟨🟩) is optional; leave blank if unknown.
- Do not set `publish:` unless the user asks.
